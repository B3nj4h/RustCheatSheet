Simple journey of becoming a rustacean

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("In the land of code, strong and rust,");
    println!("Lives a crab named Ferris, in code we trust.");
    println!("With pincers sharp and eyes so keen,");
    println!("He guards our memory, like a programming dream.");
}
```
